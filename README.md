# Prettier Java

![Prettier Banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prettier/prettier-logo/master/images/prettier-banner-light.png)

## How it works

A Prettier plugin must first parse the source code of the target language
into a traversable data structure (Usually an **A**bstract **S**yntax **T**ree)
and then print out that data structure in a "pretty" style.

Prettier-Java uses a [Java-Parser](./packages/java-parser) implemented in JavaScript using the
[Chevrotain Parser Building Toolkit for JavaScript](https://github.com/SAP/chevrotain).
What this means is that unlike many other prettier plugins,
prettier-java has **no additional runtime pre-requisites** (e.g: Python executable).
It could even be used inside a browser.

## Status

- Parser package alpha version done.
- Now Investigating the re-printer (actually prettier-java package)

## Road map to Alpha

- Parser Package

  - [x] POC: optimized backtracking to handle Java Grammar non LL(k) nature.
  - [x] Milestone 1 - Success parsing ["Java Design Patterns"](https://github.com/iluwatar/java-design-patterns) repo.
  - [x] Milestone 2 - Success parsing ["spring-boot"](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot) repo.
  - [x] Investigate performance optimizations.
  - [x] Release Alpha version to npm. - https://www.npmjs.com/package/java-parser

- prettier-java package

  - [ ] POC: Prettier "Re-writer" based on a Chevrotain CST instead of an AST.
  - [ ] Milestone 1 - Success cyclic rewriting ["Java Design Patterns"](https://github.com/iluwatar/java-design-patterns) repo.
  - [ ] Milestone 2 - Success parsing ["spring-boot"](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot) repo.
